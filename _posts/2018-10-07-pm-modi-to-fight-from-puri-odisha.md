If rumours are to be believed Prime Minister Narendra Modi will fight from Puri parliamentary constituency in 2019 general elections. The groundwork for PM Modi to contest from Puri was prepared by sounding the poll bugle for 2019 elections by addressing a rally in another Cuttack on May 26 to celebrate four years of his government. While Republic TV - CVoter and ABP news survey has given 13 seats to BJP out of 21 in Odisha, if PM decides to contest from Puri this might further increase. It's a no secret that PM Modi enjoys a great support base among young and rural population. The amazing results by BJP during previous Panchayat elections must have given him more confidence that he can win from Puri. No matter what, it will be a matter o pride for Odisha and Puri that the PM will be contesting. This will bring much needed development to Odisha which is badly needed after what we call a stagnant growth and administrative apathy.
